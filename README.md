# Pitch Switch

The repository is a frontend part of the project created for Methods of Creating Database Applications course at my University. Backend part can be accessed [here](https://github.com/KacperChabros/PitchSwitchBackend).  
The proposed database application is designed for searching information and sharing thoughts about the football transfer market. It allows users to search for information about clubs, players, and transfers, as well as engage in discussions under posts created by sports journalists.

### Front-end – Web Application
* The user interface is implemented using **_TypeScript_** and the **React** library.
* **_Axios HTTP Client_** is used for sending API requests.
* Styling is handled with the **_Tailwind CSS_** framework.

### Back-end – Application Logic
* The application logic is implemented using **_C# with .NET 8.0 and ASP.NET Core to create a Web API_**.
* **_Entity Framework Core_** is used for database communication.
* Application access is managed using **_JWT tokens_**.
* Authentication is implemented with **_ASP.NET Core Identity_**.

### Database
* All data stored by the application is maintained in an **_MS SQL Server_** database.
* **_SQL Server Management_** Studio is used for database management.

## Setup
After cloning the repository one should install the libraries using `npm install` and start the application using `npm start`. Backend from [backend repository](https://github.com/KacperChabros/PitchSwitchBackend) must be started separately for the app to work properly.
